Pico is a stupidly simple, blazing fast, flat file CMS.

This is Pico's [Composer][] starter project. `picocms/pico-composer` is the frame for basically all Pico installations starting with Pico 2.0, but doesn't consist of any considerable code itself. It's main purpose is to simply depend on Pico. Please refer to the ["Install"][MainRepoInstall] and ["Upgrade"][MainRepoUpgrade] sections of our main repository for information about how to install, upgrade and use Pico.
