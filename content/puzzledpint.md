# Puzzled Pint

The members of QuiPZ host the Zurich, Switzerland edition of Puzzled Pint, an English language social puzzle solving event which takes place at bars/pubs on the second Tuesday of every month in multiple cities around the world. Come and join us!

## When and where?

The next event is on **Tuesday 12th March**. We will be there to welcome you **from 7pm until 10pm.**

This month we're at [The Alehouse – Palmhof](https://www.alehouse.ch/), Universitätstrasse 23, 8006 Zurich ([Google map](https://g.page/TheAlehouseZH?share)). It's just up the road from ETH Zentrum and the nearest tram stops are ETH/Universitätsspital and Haldenbach.

## Do I need to be there for the whole 3 hours?

Nope, it's all very casual, but someone will be available to hand out puzzles and hints during those times. Depending as to how seasoned a puzzler you are you can expect to take around 2 hours to work through all the puzzles, but you don't have to finish them all on the night (or at all).

## Do I need a team?

Teams of 3-5 people tend to work best for these puzzles, but feel free to come alone and we'll help slot you into a team on the night.

## How much does it cost?

Puzzled Pint is **free to play**. Any food and drink you choose to consume is on you, though (and if you feel like buying your friendly game controllers a drink then we aren't going to stop you).

## What sort of puzzles are they?

If you have ever taken part in a Puzzle Hunt then you will have a good idea what to expect. The puzzles tend to have a number of parts and may incorporate traditional puzzles like crosswords, word searches, cryptograms, word play and logic problems. Even if you have never done anything like this before, if you like any sort of logic or word puzzle, or enjoy watching the TV show [Only Connect](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClIpxKAC9kaOgjexqrvan9g) you’ll like these.

To get a proper idea, you can [download and try some puzzles from the archive](https://puzzledpint.com/events/).

Note: Puzzled Pint is a neither run by or sponsored by Quiz & Puzzle Club Zurich, but we do provide a free home for the Zurich website plus printing and hosting.
