# Quiz & Puzzle Club Zurich

Founded in February 2024, the purpose of the Quiz & Puzzle Club Zurich (QuiPZ) is to give people the opportunity to create and solve puzzles ("Rätseln") and quizzes in a sociable atmosphere. We hold regular free puzzle and quiz evenings that anyone can attend ([check out our MeetUp group](https://www.meetup.com/puzzled-pint-zurich/) – currently still labelled as "Puzzled Pint Zurich"), as well as a smaller number of paid for and members-only events to raise funds to support the club. As we are primarily a social club, we do not have an overarching league or ranking system, although individual events may be competitive.

Membership will be open soon.
