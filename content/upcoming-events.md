### Afterwork Taproom Quiz at Brauerei Oerlikon at Brauerei Oerlikon AG, Zürich, ZH

*Wed, Mar 6, 2024, 6:00 PM CET*

Ooh, a new venture in a new venue! Come and join Paul in the taproom at Brauerei Oerlikon for a few afterwork drinks and an English-speaking quiz at 6.00pm on Wednesday 6th March. As ever, there will be nothing (too) obscure, so fun for everyone no matter if your first language is English, German, French or Klingon.

**Do I need to book or RSVP?**

Nah, you're probably golden. _Note: an RSVP on MeetUp would be helpful to give an idea of interest but is not required._

**Do I need a team?**

You don't _need_ a team but it'll be more fun if you can bring along a few friends (or we might be able to slot you into an existing team on the day). Maximum recommended team size of 6 people, please!

Oh, ein neues Projekt an einem neuen Ort! Komm am Mittwoch, den 6. März um 18.00 Uhr zu Paul in den Taproom der Brauerei Oerlikon für ein paar Afterwork-Drinks und ein englisches Quiz. Wie immer nichts (zu) Obskures, also Spass für alle, egal ob Englisch, Deutsch, Französisch oder Klingonisch die Muttersprache ist.

**Muss ich mich anmelden oder RSVP?**

Nein, das ist kein Problem. Hinweis: Eine RSVP auf MeetUp wäre hilfreich, um Interesse zu bekunden, ist aber nicht notwendig.

**Brauche ich ein Team?**

Du brauchst kein Team, aber es macht mehr Spass, wenn du ein paar Freunde mitbringst (oder wir können dich an dem Tag in ein bestehendes Team aufnehmen). Die empfohlene Teamgrösse ist maximal 6 Personen, bitte!

### Weekly Pub Quiz at The Alehouse at The Alehouse, Zürich, ZH

Come and join us at The Alehouse for our weekly English-speaking pub quiz at 6.30pm every Sunday. Five rounds of general knowledge questions plus a music or picture round, and nothing (too) obscure, so fun for everyone no matter if your first language is English, German, French or Klingon.

**Do I need to book or RSVP?**

It's always worth reserving a table for your team directly with The Alehouse [https://www.alehouse.ch/#reservations](https://www.alehouse.ch/#reservations) (make sure you tell them you're coming for the quiz), but there should be space for you on the night if you don't get a chance. _Note: an RSVP on MeetUp would be helpful to give an idea of interest but will not guarantee you a space!_

**Do I need a team?**

You don't _need_ a team but it'll be more fun if you can bring along a few friends (or we might be able to slot you into an existing team on the day). Maximum recommended team size of 6 people, please!

**Does The Alehouse serve food?**
