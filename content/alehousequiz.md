# The Alehouse Pub Quiz

![](%assets_url%/in-content-images/alehouse-pub-quiz-every-sunday.jpg)

The members of QuiPZ organise and host Switzerland's friendliest English-speaking pub quiz at The Alehouse every Sunday night at 18:30. Five rounds of general knowledge questions plus a picture/music round, and nothing (too) obscure, so fun for everyone no matter if your first language is English, German, French or Klingon. Come and join us!

## When and where?

**Every Sunday from 6.30pm until 9.30pm**

You'll find us at [The Alehouse – Palmhof](https://www.alehouse.ch/), Universitätstrasse 23, 8006 Zurich ([Google map](https://g.page/TheAlehouseZH?share)). It's just up the road from ETH Zentrum and the nearest tram stops are ETH/Universitätsspital and Haldenbach.

## Do I need a team?

Teams of 3-5 people tend to work best for these puzzles, but feel free to come alone and we'll help slot you into a team on the night.

## How much does it cost?

The Alehouse Pub Quiz is **free to play**. Any food and drink you choose to consume is on you, though.
